Uses opencv to create hotkeys to different directories for faster dataset organization.

Required directory structure:
    top directory
        subdir 1
            images
        subdir 2
            images
        subdir n
            images

Controls:
    3 and 4/space to cycle backward and forward through the image pool, respectively
    ` for exiting

Set your hotkeys in the key_mappings json file
    * restart to use hotkeys added while the script is running
